# Auto Filler - Project Context

## Overview

Auto Filler is an AI-driven browser extension designed to simplify manual web application testing by recording and replaying user interactions. It captures a sequence of actions performed on a webpage (such as clicks, form inputs, navigation, and more) and allows testers and developers to replay these scenarios with a single click.

## Purpose & Goals

* **Streamline Manual Testing**: Reduce the effort required for repetitive manual test cases by automating recording and playback of user flows.
* **Increase Productivity**: Enable developers and QA engineers to quickly validate application changes without writing code.
* **Improve Accuracy**: Minimize human error in repetitive testing tasks by ensuring consistent execution of recorded scenarios.

## Key Features

* **Action Recording**: Track user interactions (clicks, typing, selections, navigation) within the browser.
* **Scenario Management**: Create, name, and organize multiple test scenarios for different user journeys.
* **Playback Engine**: Replay recorded actions in sequence to simulate user behavior.
* **AI-Assisted Replay**: Use AI to adapt to minor UI changes (e.g., shifted element positions) and maintain scenario robustness.
* **Export & Share**: Export scenarios as JSON or shareable links for team collaboration.



## Scope

* **In-Scope**:

  * Recording common user actions
  * Scenario playback within the same browser session
  * Basic AI heuristics for element matching
  * Simple UI for scenario creation and management
* **Out-of-Scope (Phase 1)**:

  * Cross-browser synchronization
  * Advanced AI learning from historical data
  * Integration with CI/CD pipelines (to be considered in later phases)

## Technology Stack

* **Browser Extension Framework**: WebExtensions API (compatible with Chrome, Firefox, Edge)
* **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (with a framework like React or Vue.js)
* **AI Module**: TensorFlow\.js or a lightweight ML library for element matching
* **Data Storage**: Local storage or IndexedDB for scenarios

## High-Level Architecture

```
User Browser
    └──> Auto Filler Extension
          ├── Recorder (captures DOM events)
          ├── Scenario Store (IndexedDB)
          └── Playback Engine (replays events)
                └── AI Adapter (smart element matching)
```

## Benefits

* **Rapid Validation**: Test scenarios can be rerun in seconds.
* **Collaborative Testing**: Share scenarios with team members easily.
* **Maintenance Efficiency**: Update scenarios quickly when application UI changes.

## Success Criteria

* Users can record and replay at least 90% of common user flows without manual scripting.
* Recorded scenarios remain robust against minor UI updates.
* Positive user feedback on ease of use and time saved in manual testing.

## Next Steps

1. Prototype the recording and playback functionality.
2. Develop a minimal UI for scenario management.
3. Integrate basic AI heuristics for element matching.
4. Conduct user testing with QA engineers for feedback.
