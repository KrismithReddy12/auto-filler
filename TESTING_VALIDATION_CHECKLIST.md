# üß™ Cross-Page Navigation Testing Validation Checklist

## Pre-Testing Setup ‚úÖ

### 1. Extension Installation
- [ ] Load unpacked extension in Chrome (`chrome://extensions/`)
- [ ] Enable "Developer mode"
- [ ] Verify extension icon appears in toolbar
- [ ] Test extension popup opens correctly

### 2. Test Pages Access
- [ ] Navigate to `file:///c:/Users/RossK/OneDrive/Documents/Auto%20Filler%20ADP/test-page.html`
- [ ] Verify page loads completely
- [ ] Test "üîó Go to Page 2" button manually
- [ ] Confirm navigation to `test-page-2.html` works
- [ ] Test "‚¨ÖÔ∏è Go Back to Page 1" button

## Core Functionality Validation üéØ

### 3. Single-Page Recording (Baseline Test)
- [ ] Record actions on first page only (no navigation)
- [ ] Playback single-page scenario successfully
- [ ] **Result:** Should work perfectly (existing functionality)

### 4. Cross-Page Recording Test
- [ ] Start recording new scenario: "Cross-Page Test"
- [ ] Close popup after starting recording
- [ ] Fill form fields on page 1:
  - [ ] First Name: `John`
  - [ ] Last Name: `Doe`
  - [ ] Email: `john.doe@test.com`
  - [ ] Country: `United States`
  - [ ] Interests: `Cross-page navigation testing`
- [ ] Click "üîó Go to Page 2" button
- [ ] **Verify:** Page navigates to test-page-2.html
- [ ] Continue recording on page 2:
  - [ ] Feedback: `Great cross-page functionality!`
  - [ ] Rating: `‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Excellent`
  - [ ] Recommend: `Yes, definitely!`
  - [ ] Click "‚úÖ Submit Feedback"
- [ ] Open popup and stop recording
- [ ] Save scenario

### 5. Cross-Page Playback Test
- [ ] Navigate back to test-page.html
- [ ] Clear all form fields manually
- [ ] Open extension popup
- [ ] Select "Cross-Page Test" scenario
- [ ] Set playback speed to "Fast"
- [ ] Click "Play Scenario"
- [ ] Close popup and observe

## Success Criteria ‚úÖ

### Expected Playback Behavior:
1. **Page 1 Actions:**
   - [ ] Form fields fill automatically
   - [ ] All values match recorded data
   - [ ] Navigation button gets clicked

2. **Navigation:**
   - [ ] Page automatically navigates to test-page-2.html
   - [ ] No manual intervention required
   - [ ] No errors in browser console

3. **Page 2 Actions:**
   - [ ] Form fields on page 2 fill automatically
   - [ ] All values match recorded data
   - [ ] Submit button gets clicked
   - [ ] Success message appears

4. **Completion:**
   - [ ] Extension popup shows "Scenario playback completed successfully!"
   - [ ] No JavaScript errors in console
   - [ ] All recorded actions executed

## Advanced Validation üöÄ

### 6. Edge Case Testing
- [ ] **Multiple Navigations:** Record 3+ page navigation scenario
- [ ] **Playback Speed Variation:** Test Instant, Fast, and Normal speeds
- [ ] **Error Recovery:** Test with one broken element selector
- [ ] **Browser Compatibility:** Test in Chrome and Edge

### 7. Performance Validation
- [ ] **Large Scenarios:** Test with 20+ actions across pages
- [ ] **Network Conditions:** Test with slower internet connection
- [ ] **Memory Usage:** Monitor extension memory consumption during playback

## Troubleshooting üîß

### If Cross-Page Playback Fails:

#### Check Browser Console (F12)
- Look for error messages during playback
- Note any extension-related errors
- Verify content script injection on target pages

#### Common Issues:
1. **Playback stops after navigation:**
   - Verify `onTabReady()` function is triggering
   - Check if target page allows content scripts
   - Ensure 1000ms delay is sufficient for page load

2. **Actions don't execute on new page:**
   - Verify element selectors are still valid
   - Check if page structure matches recorded elements
   - Ensure content script is injected properly

3. **Navigation doesn't occur:**
   - Verify navigation action was recorded
   - Check if target URL is accessible
   - Look for JavaScript errors preventing navigation

## Success Metrics üìä

### Minimal Success (Basic Cross-Page):
- ‚úÖ Record actions on page 1
- ‚úÖ Navigate to page 2 via button click
- ‚úÖ Continue recording on page 2
- ‚úÖ Playback executes all actions across both pages

### Complete Success (Production Ready):
- ‚úÖ All actions in minimal success
- ‚úÖ Multiple navigation scenarios work
- ‚úÖ Error handling gracefully manages failures
- ‚úÖ Performance remains smooth with large scenarios
- ‚úÖ Cross-browser compatibility confirmed

## Final Validation ‚ú®

### Ready for Production When:
- [ ] All core functionality tests pass
- [ ] Edge cases handled gracefully
- [ ] Performance meets requirements
- [ ] No breaking changes to existing features
- [ ] Cross-browser compatibility confirmed

---

**üéØ Success Indicator:** If you can record a scenario on one page, navigate to another page, continue recording, and then replay the entire sequence seamlessly with all actions executing correctly, the cross-page navigation feature is working perfectly!

**üìù Note:** Document any issues found during testing in the project notes for future reference.
