# üîó Cross-Page Navigation Testing Guide

## Overview
This guide helps you test the new cross-page navigation feature that allows Auto Filler to record and replay scenarios that span multiple webpages.

## What Was Fixed
**Previous Issue:** When recording a scenario with navigation actions (like clicking links or buttons that navigate to new pages), the playback would only execute the first page's actions and then stop when navigation occurred.

**Solution:** Implemented a background script coordination system that:
- Tracks playback state across page navigations
- Batches actions by page
- Continues playback after navigation completes
- Maintains the original recording and UI functionality

## Test Scenario: Multi-Page Form Flow

### Step 1: Set Up the Test
1. Open the Auto Filler extension
2. Navigate to `test-page.html` (the first test page)
3. Click the extension icon to open the popup

### Step 2: Record Cross-Page Scenario
1. Enter scenario name: "Cross-Page Test"
2. Click **"Start Recording"** 
3. **Close the popup** (recording continues in background)
4. On test-page.html:
   - Fill in the "First Name" field: `John`
   - Fill in the "Last Name" field: `Doe`
   - Fill in the "Email" field: `john.doe@example.com`
   - Select country: `United States`
   - Fill in interests: `Testing cross-page navigation`
   - Click **"üîó Go to Page 2"** button (this navigates to test-page-2.html)
5. On test-page-2.html:
   - Fill in feedback: `Amazing cross-page navigation feature!`
   - Select rating: `‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Excellent`
   - Select recommend: `Yes, definitely!`
   - Click **"‚úÖ Submit Feedback"**
6. Open the extension popup again
7. Click **"Stop Recording"**
8. Click **"Save"** to save the scenario

### Step 3: Test Playback
1. **Refresh** the first page (test-page.html) or navigate back to it
2. Open the extension popup
3. Select your saved "Cross-Page Test" scenario
4. Choose playback speed (try "Fast" for visible results)
5. Click **"Play Scenario"**
6. **Close the popup** and watch the magic happen!

### Expected Results
‚úÖ **Recording Phase:**
- All actions on both pages should be captured
- Navigation action should be recorded when clicking "Go to Page 2"
- Recording should continue seamlessly after navigation

‚úÖ **Playback Phase:**
- Actions execute on the first page (form filling)
- Page automatically navigates to test-page-2.html
- Actions continue on the second page (feedback form)
- All form fields get filled automatically
- Buttons get clicked in sequence
- Status shows "Scenario playback completed successfully!"

## Advanced Testing

### Test Different Navigation Types
1. **Internal Links:** Test with `<a href="...">` links
2. **Form Submissions:** Test with forms that navigate after submission
3. **JavaScript Navigation:** Test with `window.location.href` assignments
4. **External Sites:** Test navigation to external websites like Google

### Test Edge Cases
1. **Slow Networks:** Test with slow internet to ensure navigation detection works
2. **Multiple Navigations:** Record scenarios with 3+ page navigations
3. **Navigation Failures:** Test with broken links (should gracefully handle errors)
4. **Browser Back/Forward:** Test scenarios that use browser navigation

## Troubleshooting

### If Playback Stops After Navigation
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify the content script is injected on the target page
- Ensure the target page allows extension content scripts

### If Actions Don't Execute on New Page
- Wait for page to fully load before manual testing
- Check if the target elements exist on the new page
- Verify element selectors are still valid

### If Navigation Doesn't Occur
- Check if the navigation action was recorded properly
- Verify the target URL is accessible
- Look for JavaScript errors preventing navigation

## Performance Notes

- **Instant Mode:** Best for development and testing
- **Fast Mode:** Good for demonstrations with visible action flow
- **Normal Mode:** Most human-like, best for real-world testing scenarios

## Browser Compatibility

‚úÖ **Chrome:** Full support  
‚úÖ **Edge:** Full support  
üîÑ **Firefox:** Should work (may need testing)

**üéâ Success Indicator:** If you can record on one page, navigate to another, continue recording, and then replay the entire sequence seamlessly, the cross-page navigation feature is working perfectly!
